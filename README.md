# Conway's Game of Life

---

**_My interpretation of Conway's Game of Life in rather futuristic perspective._**

I've made a **tutorial** with all the key elements that you need to know. Furthermore you can press _Wikipedia_ button to learn more about the game or just to check _cool patterns_!

## Few words about this project

While seeking for an idea for a project to my portfolio I accidentaly came across `Conway's Game of Life`.

I really liked the idea of a world with it's own rules and that you can actually create a simple form of "life" and watch it evolve in real time. Then I figured that it would be awesome to implement the game in **React.js** - currently my main field of interest - especially with all the new knowledge about **React Hooks** that I recently grasped.

Additionally, I found it worth trying something new for styling and since I heard about **Tailwind CSS** so many times, I thought it would be good idea to give it a try.

There's still a lot room for improvement. Because it is not a huge and complicated project I kept most of the code in one component, nevertheless I'll try to extract as much code as possible to seperate ones to make it cleaner (I'm short on time, I'm really looking foreward to my first job as a _Junior Frontend Developer_ ðŸ˜…).

I took care of **responsiveness** on all desktop resolutions, also I styled landing page for mobile, but since the game demands quite a big screen, the playground itself does not support mobile resolutions (at least for now).

> Enjoy the game!

### Which technologies did I use??

As stated above two major solutions are:

- `React.js (especially Hooks)`
- `Tailwind CSS`

Additionally I utilized:

- `React Router DOM`
- `immer`
- `Font Awesome`

App's build setup - `Create react app`

npm run start
